### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__:

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Performing (2)** - I liked that you had a wireframe, but your
user stories could be improved by having them better match the
format of role, goal, and reason, e.g.

> As a user, I want to click cards so I can see what's on the back.
> As a user, I want to see the cards that have been flipped over
> and matched so I can focus on clicking the remaining cards

* __Technical Requirements__:

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Progressing (1)** - This was very close to *performing*, but the
app was missing a few features, specifically shuffling the cards
and pausing so I could see the second card flipped over. I'm
confident with a bit more time you could make a lot of progress on
those features though.

* __Code Quality__:

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Progressing (1)** - Please see my inline comments for more info
on this section.

* __Creativity/Interface__:

>Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**Performing (2)** - I liked your design a lot! I'm a bit confused
because the version I cloned doesn't quite match the version you demo'd
in terms of style. Did you commit your latest versions?
